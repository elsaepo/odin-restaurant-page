## Functionality

* **Navigation** - The website DOM was created almost entirely in JavaScript (just a barebones HTML file with an empty div), and was made to gain experience with building wesites using webpack. Not meant to look pretty.

## Learning outcomes & challenges

* This was my first experience with building a website using **webpack** - a tool for compiling and bundling JavaScript modules. Definitely a learning experience - ran into a few confusing moments, such as bundling images and other files and where to call their source from. ALso - images and JavaScript variables? New to me.
* Gained more experience with **building DOM elements** with JavaScript, as all of the website content was built this way. It can get very out of hand very fast, and was a battle to keep my code DRY.
* Importing and exporting JavaScript **modules** throughout files was a first in this lesson - previously all of the logic would be held in one file with "modules", but the ability to link files between each other is very powerful - which webpack helps a heap with!
